Occluded Surface (OS) Program
OS is a package of programs to calculate the occluded surface and atomic packing of protein model structures.
Occluded surface is defined as the molecular surface that is less than 2.8 Angstrom from the surface of neighboring non-bonded atoms. That is, if a water molecule cannot fit between two atoms they occlude each other. Occluded surface is similar to buried surface but is more sensitive to packing geometry than buried surface identified using a rolling probe.
